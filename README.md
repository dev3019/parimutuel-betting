# Parimutuel Betting Project

The ParimutuelBetting smart contract is a decentralized betting system where users can place bets on various outcomes of a prediction event. Unlike traditional fixed-odds betting, this system pools all the bets and distributes the total pool proportionally to the winners. The contract allows for multiple prediction events to be created, managed, and resolved by administrators.

Try running some of the following tasks:

## Compile the contracts
```npx hardhat compile```

## Test the interactment
